## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000079 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

# Model Notes


This model is according to the paper of _A model for the dynamics of human
weight cycling_ by A. Goldbeter 2006.The figure3 (A) and (B) have been
reproduced by Copasi 4.0.19(development) and SBMLodeSolver.The writer of the
paper did not specify any units for the metabolites, so the creator of the
model did not define the units as well.Both Q and R are normalized to vary
between 0 and 1.
